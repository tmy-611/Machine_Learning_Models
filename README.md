# house_pricing
Build a Machine Learning model in Spark and Java to predict the house pricing.

I am working with dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

In this project, I follow each steps below:
1. Define the purpose
- Build a Machine Learning model for practicing and improving skill
- Use the Regression Model
2. Explore and Preprocessing data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Data Splitting
3. Select and build a model
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Tune the model
7. Save model
